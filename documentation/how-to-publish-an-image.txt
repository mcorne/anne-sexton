How to publish the image of a new poem
-----------------------------------------


1. Find a picture
-----------------

- find a picture on the internet or in a book
- verify if possible that the picture has no copyright restriction


2. Edit the image
-----------------

- resize the image to no bigger than 800 X 600 px, the width should greater than the height
- apply the automatic gamma correction, the automatic contrast correction, etc... as needed
- give the image an explicit name, ideally the poem title
- save the image locally in the "images" directory as .jpg

Note that this is the image that will be played in the slideshow and published along with the text of the poem. 


3. Save the edited image to picasaweb
-------------------------------------

- save the original image scan to the album "Anne Sexton" (add the photo):
  https://picasaweb.google.com/109570780620280936353/AnneSexton
- sort the album (organize /sort photos by filename / done)
- add a caption (actions / caption)

Adding a caption:
- copy & paste the caption of the previous image to use as model
- change the poem title to the actual poem title
- select a few lines of the translated poem that relates to the image, copy & paste those lines in place of the "model" lines 


4. Save the image source URL
----------------------------

- add the image source URL in documentation/image-sources.txt

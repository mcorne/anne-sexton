How to edit and publish a poem
------------------------------

All steps are mandatory for a new poem.
Steps 1, 3, 4, 7 are not applicable for an existing poem.


1. Create the .csv poem file
----------------------------

(not applicable to an existing poem)
- copy and paste "data/example.csv" into "data/poems"
- rename "data/poems/example.csv" into "data/poems/<poem-french-title>.csv"


2. Open "<poem-french-title>.csv" in the "data" directory with OpenOffice
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Set the options:
- charset = UTF-8
- cell separator = tab (tabulation)
- text delimiter = " (double-quote)


3. Add the original English text
--------------------------------

(not applicable to an existing poem)
- look for the original text on the internet  
- copy and paste the "title", the "introduction" if any, and each "strophe" in the "english" column
  see an example of "introduction" in "la-mousse-de-sa-peau.html"
- verify the text in the paper edition "The Complete Poems" by Anne Sexton, Houghton Mifflin


4. Translate into French
------------------------

(not applicable to an existing poem)
- copy and paste the English text into google translate
- copy and paste the (roughly) translated text into the "french" column
- update the "source" for both English and French columns
  make a link to the English text if it comes from an authority site, eg http://www.poetryfoundation.org
  see the "source" in "la-mousse-de-sa-peau.html" as an example

  
5. Fix the translation
-----------------------

- fix the translation
- add "notes" as needed in the "notes" column, and "note references" within the French text
  see examples of notes in "data/example.csv"
- read aloud, the translation must "flow" naturally although remaining close to the original text 
  according to the translating guidelines in "widgets\introduction.html"


6. Complete the poem information
--------------------------------

(mandatory for a new poem)
- add "other" information if necessary
  see examples of links to analysis of the text in "la-mousse-de-sa-peau.html"
- add the url to the episode image in the "image-src" cell, see below.
- add the url to the original image in the "image-href" cell, see below.

How to find the url's of the poem image:
- open the album "Anne Sexton":
  https://picasaweb.google.com/109570780620280936353/AnneSexton
- select the image
- click on "link to this photo"
- "select size" = "small 144px"
- check "image only (no link)"
- copy & paste the content of the "embed image" box into the "image-src" cell (see above)
- copy & paste the content of the "link" box into the "image-href" cell (see above)


7. Create the blog message
--------------------------

(not applicable to an existing poem)
- use the French title for the poem
- create an empty blog message with this title

Note that at this point, this message becomes the entry point of the blog, so the (current) publishing should ideally be done quickly.


8. Publish the poem
-------------------

- make sure "translation-in-progress" is present in the "type" column if the poem is to be published as translation in progress
  or remove "translation-in-progress" if the poem is to be published in its blog message
- save and close the file, do not change the CSV format settings and extension
- run the command line: publish -u <login> -p <password> -a
- copy & paste the content of "widgets/introduction.html" to the corresponding blog widget if it was updated
- copy & paste the content of "widgets/table-of-contents.html" to the corresponding blog widget if it was updated
- copy & paste the content of "widgets/copyright.html" to the corresponding blog widget, 
  this should only be necessary once every year when publishing the first poem of a year


9. Miscellaneous
----------------

- anything may be fixed in any poem, publish as explained in step 8 to automatically publish all changes
